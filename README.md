crf_dia_ident
=============
This git correspond to the CRF Code used during my phd thesis. 
It uses the grmm toolbox:
 Sutton, Charles.  "GRMM: GRaphical Models in Mallet."
    http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/grmm/. 2006.

I modified the interface and add new feature templates to use continuous features and must-not links features.

The directory example contains toy examples showing how to use the different features
